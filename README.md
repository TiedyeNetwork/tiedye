# TieDye

TieDye is a next generation financial engine. Built on top of the innovative new primitive of synthetic channels,
it allows a base layer blockchain to scale to very rapid trades on any imaginable asset or financial contract. 

## Use Cases

TieDye can be used for the creation of any financial contract imaginable, granted there is a counter-party prepared
to take the other side. Since there are incentives and strategies to hedge trades, market makers will be able to make
profit by accepting many connections with little risk to their underlying collateral. Trading happens entirely offchain
inside of a special kind of state channel known as synthetic channels, that allow rapid updates.

TieDye is agnostic to the kind of financial agreements that exist on the second layer network, some products that can
be built on top of the base TieDye blockchain include:

- Margin trading. Imagine a trustless BitMEX, where you could exceed even 100x leverage and never are at risk of losing
funds due to an exit scam. Instead of the limited number of assets offered on centralized exchanges (7 or 8 different contract 
types are supported on BitMEX for example), TieDEX could offer leveraged positions on _any_ asset, cryptoasset or 
traditional, with very little-- possibly no-- overhead to the counterparty.

- Prediction markets...

- Fiat currencies, exotic derivatives, complex financial contracts. The TieDye settlement layer is completely agnostic
to the kinds of assets that are traded inside of its synthetic channels. They could be fiat currencies like the euro,
oil futures, or leveraged exposure with interest. As long as there's an accepted price oracle, it can be traded.

## Scalability

Tiedye is channel framework built on a specialized blockchain settlement layer, which means it will be intensely scalable.
